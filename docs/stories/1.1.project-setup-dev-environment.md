## Dev Notes

### Technology Stack Context

Based on the architecture documentation, this project uses:

**Backend Framework**: Flask 2.3+ with Flask-SQLAlchemy 3.0+, Flask-Migrate, Flask-CORS, and Marshmallow 3.19+ for serialization [Source: architecture/technology-stack-details.md#backend-framework]

**Processing & Queue Management**: Celery 5.3+ with Redis 7.0+ as message broker and caching layer [Source: architecture/technology-stack-details.md#processing-queue-management]

**External APIs**: Yandex SpeechKit Python SDK as primary STT service [Source: architecture/technology-stack-details.md#external-apis]

**File Processing**: pydub 0.25+ for audio manipulation, librosa 0.10+ for audio analysis, FFmpeg as system dependency [Source: architecture/technology-stack-details.md#file-processing]

**Frontend Stack**: HTML5 with Bootstrap 5.3, Vanilla JavaScript ES6+, WebSocket/Server-Sent Events for real-time updates [Source: architecture/technology-stack-details.md#frontend-stack]

**Development & Testing**: pytest 7.4+, pytest-cov, black formatting, flake8 linting, pre-commit hooks [Source: architecture/technology-stack-details.md#development-testing]

**Containerization**: Docker 24+ with Docker Compose, nginx for reverse proxy, gunicorn as WSGI server [Source: architecture/technology-stack-details.md#containerization-deployment]

### System Architecture Context

The application follows a layered architecture with:

- Frontend Web UI for upload interface, status tracking, and results display
- Backend API (Flask) for file management, processing queue, and export generation
- External Services integration with Yandex SpeechKit
- Data Layer using SQLite (MVP), file system storage, Redis for queuing [Source: architecture/system-architecture-overview.md#high-level-architecture]

### Directory Structure Requirements

Based on acceptance criteria and architecture documentation, the project structure should include:

- `backend/` - Flask application code
- `frontend/` - HTML/CSS/JavaScript static files
- `tests/` - Unit and integration test files
- `docs/` - Documentation files
- Python package structure with proper `__init__.py` files

### Security and Configuration Context

Environment configuration must handle API keys, database URLs, and deployment settings securely. The system requires proper input validation, CSRF protection, and rate limiting [Source: architecture/security-architecture.md concepts]

### Testing Standards

**Testing Framework**: pytest 7.4+ with pytest-cov for coverage reporting
**Test Structure**: Tests should be organized in tests/ directory
**Coverage Requirements**: Unit tests covering database operations, service classes, and error scenarios as specified in AC
**Testing Approach**: Include unit testing as explicit subtasks for each component

### Development Workflow

The development environment should support:

- Local development with Docker Compose
- Automated code quality checks via pre-commit hooks
- CI/CD pipeline for testing and quality assurance
- Hot-reload capability for efficient development

## Testing

**Test Location**: tests/ directory in project root  
**Test Standards**: Use pytest 7.4+ framework with pytest-cov for coverage reporting  
**Testing Frameworks**: pytest for unit testing, coverage reporting required for service classes and database operations  
**Specific Requirements**: Unit tests must cover database operations, service classes, and error scenarios as per acceptance criteria
