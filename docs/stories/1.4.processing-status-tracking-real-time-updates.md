## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.3 completion:

- Frontend template structure established with base.html and responsive design
- JavaScript namespace pattern (AudioTranscriber) ready for extension
- Upload functionality working with job_id generation and tracking
- Backend routes structure in place for extending with status endpoints
- Error handling framework available for consistent error responses

### Real-time Communication Architecture

**WebSocket/Server-Sent Events Implementation** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend-technology]:

- Flask-SocketIO for WebSocket support with fallback to polling
- Server-Sent Events as fallback for simpler browser compatibility
- Real-time status updates pushed from server to client
- Event-driven architecture for status changes

**Implementation Pattern**:

```python
# Backend WebSocket event emission
from flask_socketio import SocketIO, emit

@socketio.on('subscribe_job_status')
def handle_status_subscription(data):
    job_id = data['job_id']
    join_room(job_id)

def emit_job_status_update(job_id, status_data):
    socketio.emit('job_status_update', status_data, room=job_id)
```

**Frontend WebSocket Connection** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend-technology]:

```javascript
// Client-side WebSocket handling
const socket = io();
socket.emit("subscribe_job_status", { job_id: jobId });
socket.on("job_status_update", function (data) {
  updateStatusDisplay(data);
});
```

### File Structure and Locations

**Frontend Extensions** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#frontend-structure]:

- Status page template: `frontend/templates/status.html`
- Status JavaScript: `frontend/static/js/status.js`
- Status styling: `frontend/static/css/status.css`
- Partial components: `frontend/templates/partials/status_card.html`

**Backend Route Extensions** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#backend-application-structure]:

- Status routes: `backend/app/routes/jobs.py` (extend existing)
- WebSocket handlers: `backend/app/routes/realtime.py` (new)
- Processing services: `backend/app/services/` (extend existing)

### Database Extensions for Status Tracking

**Job Model Extensions** [Source: architecture/database-design.md]:

```python
# Additional fields for job status tracking
class Job(db.Model):
    # ... existing fields
    progress_percentage = db.Column(db.Integer, default=0)
    processing_phase = db.Column(db.String(50), default='uploaded')
    estimated_completion = db.Column(db.DateTime)
    queue_position = db.Column(db.Integer)
    can_cancel = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=True)
```

**Processing History Model** [Source: architecture/database-design.md]:

```python
class ProcessingHistory(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    file_size = db.Column(db.BigInteger, nullable=False)
    processing_duration = db.Column(db.Float, nullable=False)  # seconds
    created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
```

### API Endpoints for Status Management

**Status Tracking Endpoints** [Source: architecture/api-architecture.md]:

- `GET /api/v1/jobs/{job_id}/status` - Get current job status
- `POST /api/v1/jobs/{job_id}/cancel` - Cancel processing job
- `GET /api/v1/jobs/{job_id}/queue-position` - Get queue position
- `GET /api/v1/system/queue-status` - Get overall queue status

**WebSocket Events**:

- `subscribe_job_status` - Subscribe to job status updates
- `job_status_update` - Receive real-time status updates
- `queue_position_update` - Receive queue position changes

### Processing Phase Management

**Processing Phases** [Source: architecture/file-processing-pipeline.md]:

1. **Uploading**: File upload and validation complete
2. **Processing**: Audio analysis and transcription in progress
3. **Generating Output**: Formatting transcript and preparing results
4. **Complete**: Processing finished, results available

**Phase Transition Logic**:

```python
class ProcessingPhase(Enum):
    UPLOADED = "uploaded"
    PROCESSING = "processing"
    GENERATING_OUTPUT = "generating_output"
    COMPLETED = "completed"
    FAILED = "failed"
    CANCELLED = "cancelled"
```

### Progress Estimation Implementation

**Estimation Algorithm**:

- Base estimation on file size (MB) and historical processing times
- Update estimates during processing based on actual progress
- Factor in current queue load and available workers
- Store historical data for continuous improvement

**Estimation Formula**:

```python
def estimate_processing_time(file_size_mb):
    # Base time: ~1-2 minutes per MB for Yandex SpeechKit
    base_time = file_size_mb * 90  # seconds

    # Adjust for queue load
    queue_multiplier = get_queue_load_factor()

    # Historical adjustment
    historical_avg = get_historical_average(file_size_mb)

    return max(base_time * queue_multiplier, historical_avg)
```

### Mobile and Touch Optimization

**Responsive Design Requirements** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend-technology]:

- Bootstrap 5.3 responsive utilities for mobile optimization
- Touch-friendly controls with appropriate sizing (44px minimum)
- Swipe gestures for status page navigation
- Optimized WebSocket connection management for mobile networks

### Error Handling and Recovery

**Error Types and Handling**:

- **Connection Errors**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- **Processing Errors**: Clear error messages with suggested actions
- **Timeout Errors**: Option to extend processing or cancel
- **Validation Errors**: Redirect back to upload with error context

**Recovery Strategies**:

- WebSocket reconnection on network restoration
- Status recovery from REST API after connection issues
- Local storage backup of job status for page refresh scenarios

### Security Considerations

**WebSocket Security** [Source: architecture/security-architecture.md]:

- CSRF token validation for WebSocket connections
- Job ID validation to prevent unauthorized status access
- Rate limiting on status update subscriptions
- Secure cleanup of cancelled job resources

### Performance Considerations

**Real-time Update Optimization**:

- Debounced status updates to prevent excessive WebSocket traffic
- Connection pooling for multiple concurrent users
- Efficient database queries for queue position calculation
- Cleanup of inactive WebSocket connections

## Testing
