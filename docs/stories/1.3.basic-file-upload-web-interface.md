## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.2 completion:

- Flask application structure established in backend/app/
- FileService class already implemented for upload validation and secure storage
- Upload API endpoint structure defined in routes planning
- Database models ready for job tracking with job_id generation
- Error handling framework available for consistent error responses

### Frontend Architecture Context

**Frontend Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend-technology]:

- HTML5 with native File API for drag-and-drop uploads
- CSS3 & Bootstrap 5.3 for responsive UI framework
- Vanilla JavaScript ES6+ for client-side programming
- No external JavaScript frameworks - progressive enhancement approach
- WebSocket/Server-Sent Events planned for real-time updates in future stories

**File Upload Implementation Pattern** [Source: architecture/file-processing-pipeline.md#upload-workflow]:

```javascript
// Frontend upload implementation approach
function handleFileUpload(file) {
  // 1. Client-side validation
  validateFileFormat(file);
  validateFileSize(file);

  // 2. Progress tracking
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append("file", file);

  // 3. XMLHttpRequest with progress
  const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xhr.upload.addEventListener("progress", updateProgress);
  xhr.addEventListener("load", handleSuccess);
  xhr.addEventListener("error", handleError);

  // 4. Submit to backend
  xhr.open("POST", "/api/v1/upload");
  xhr.send(formData);
}
```

### File Structure and Locations

**Frontend File Organization** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#frontend-structure]:

- Templates: `frontend/templates/` (base.html, index.html)
- Stylesheets: `frontend/static/css/` (main.css, upload.css)
- JavaScript: `frontend/static/js/` (main.js, upload.js, utils.js)
- Images: `frontend/static/images/` (icons, backgrounds)

**Template Structure** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#frontend-structure]:

- base.html: Base template with common elements (Bootstrap, header, footer)
- index.html: Main upload page template
- partials/upload_form.html: Reusable upload form component

### API Integration Requirements

**Upload Endpoint Specification** [Source: architecture/api-architecture.md#restful-endpoints]:

- Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/upload`
- Request: multipart/form-data with file field
- Response: JSON with job_id for tracking
- Content-Type: multipart/form-data
- Max file size: 500MB (server-side validation)

**Response Format**:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "job_id": "uuid-string",
  "filename": "original-filename.wav",
  "message": "File uploaded successfully"
}
```

### Security and Validation Requirements

**Client-Side Validation Rules** [Source: architecture/file-processing-pipeline.md#upload-workflow]:

- Supported formats: WAV, MP3, FLAC (validate by extension and MIME type)
- Maximum file size: 500MB (524,288,000 bytes)
- File content validation using File API to check headers
- Filename sanitization before display

**Security Considerations** [Source: architecture/security-architecture.md]:

- CSRF protection for form submissions using Flask-WTF
- File type validation both client and server side
- No executable file uploads allowed
- Secure filename handling for display purposes

### Bootstrap 5 Integration

**Bootstrap 5.3 Components to Use** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend-technology]:

- Responsive grid system for layout
- Form controls for file input styling
- Progress bars for upload progress
- Alert components for error/success messages
- Card components for upload area
- Utility classes for spacing and responsiveness

### Error Handling Requirements

**Error Types and Handling**:

- File validation errors: Clear messages with corrective actions
- Network errors: Retry options with exponential backoff
- Server errors: User-friendly messages with support contact
- Upload timeout: Clear timeout indication with retry option

**Error Display Pattern**:

- Toast notifications for temporary messages
- Inline validation messages for form errors
- Error page redirects for critical failures
- Loading states to prevent user confusion
