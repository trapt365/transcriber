## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.1 completion:

- Flask application structure already established in backend/app/
- SQLAlchemy and Flask-Migrate dependencies already configured in requirements.txt
- Configuration classes (Development, Production, Testing) available in backend/config.py
- Test framework with pytest already configured

### Database Schema Context

Based on architectural documentation, implement full database schema from database-design.md:

**Jobs Table Structure** [Source: architecture/database-design.md#mvp-schema-sqlite]:

```sql
CREATE TABLE jobs (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    job_id VARCHAR(36) UNIQUE NOT NULL,           -- UUID for external reference
    filename VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    original_filename VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    file_size INTEGER NOT NULL,
    file_format VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'uploaded',
    progress INTEGER DEFAULT 0,                   -- Processing progress 0-100
    error_message TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    started_at TIMESTAMP,
    completed_at TIMESTAMP,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL               -- For 24-hour cleanup
);
```

**Additional Tables Required** [Source: architecture/database-design.md#mvp-schema-sqlite]:

- job_results: Raw and formatted transcripts, metadata
- speakers: Speaker diarization information
- transcript_segments: Timestamped text segments
- usage_stats: System usage and cost tracking

**Indexes for Performance** [Source: architecture/database-design.md#mvp-schema-sqlite]:

- idx_jobs_status, idx_jobs_created_at, idx_jobs_expires_at
- idx_job_results_job_id, idx_speakers_job_id
- idx_transcript_segments_job_id, idx_transcript_segments_order

### Technology Stack Requirements

**Backend Framework** [Source: architecture/technology-stack-details.md#backend-framework]:

- Flask-SQLAlchemy 3.0+ for ORM operations
- Flask-Migrate for database migration management
- Marshmallow 3.19+ for request/response serialization

**File Processing** [Source: architecture/technology-stack-details.md#file-processing]:

- pydub 0.25+ for audio format validation
- librosa 0.10+ for audio analysis and metadata extraction

### File Processing Pipeline Context

**Upload Workflow Pattern** [Source: architecture/file-processing-pipeline.md#upload-workflow]:

```python
def process_upload(file) -> str:
    # 1. Validation
    validate_file_format(file)
    validate_file_size(file)
    validate_audio_content(file)

    # 2. Storage
    job_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    file_path = save_file_securely(file, job_id)

    # 3. Database Record
    job = create_job_record(job_id, file.filename, file_path)

    # 4. Queue for Processing
    process_audio_task.delay(job_id)

    return job_id
```

### System Architecture Context

**Core Components Integration** [Source: architecture/system-architecture-overview.md#core-components]:

- File Manager: Secure file upload, storage, validation, and automated cleanup
- Processing Engine Integration: Status tracking for Yandex SpeechKit workflow
- Data Layer: SQLite (MVP) with Redis queuing support

### File Locations and Structure

Based on existing project structure from Story 1.1:

- Models: `backend/app/models/` (job.py, enums.py, **init**.py)
- Services: `backend/app/services/` (file_service.py, processing_service.py, export_service.py)
- Utilities: `backend/app/utils/` (exceptions.py)
- Tests: `tests/unit/` for unit tests, `tests/integration/` for integration tests
- Migrations: `migrations/` directory (Flask-Migrate standard)

### Security and Validation Requirements

**File Upload Security** [Source: architecture/file-processing-pipeline.md#upload-workflow]:

- File format validation for supported types (WAV, MP3, FLAC)
- File size limits (500MB maximum)
- Audio content validation to prevent malicious uploads
- Secure temporary storage with UUID-based naming

### Error Handling Standards

**Structured Error Response Format**:

- Custom exception hierarchy for different error types
- Consistent JSON error response structure
- Detailed logging with request correlation IDs
- Service-level error handling with proper HTTP status codes

## Testing

**Test Location**: tests/ directory in project root
**Test Standards**: Use pytest 7.4+ framework with pytest-cov for coverage reporting
**Testing Frameworks**: pytest for unit testing, coverage reporting required for service classes and database operations
**Specific Requirements**: Unit tests must cover database operations, service classes, and error scenarios as per acceptance criteria

**Database Testing Strategy**:

- Use SQLite in-memory database for unit tests
- Test model relationships and constraints
- Test migration up/down operations
- Mock external dependencies in service tests

**Service Testing Requirements**:

- Test file validation logic with various file types
- Test error handling and exception propagation
- Test service interface implementations
- Integration tests for database connectivity
