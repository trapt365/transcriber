## Top Issues by Priority

**BLOCKERS:** None - PRD is ready for architect

**HIGH Priority:**
1. **API Dependency Risk:** Need concrete failover strategy when Yandex API fails
2. **Data Retention Detail:** Specific policies for GDPR compliance and user data management  
3. **Cost Monitoring:** Real-time cost tracking and budget alert implementation

**MEDIUM Priority:**
1. **Phase 2 Architecture:** More specific guidance on local processing migration path
2. **Performance Baseline:** Establish specific performance benchmarks for optimization
3. **User Onboarding:** Define initial user experience and tutorial workflow

**LOW Priority:**
1. **Competitive Analysis:** More detailed comparison with existing solutions
2. **Internationalization:** Future language expansion planning

## MVP Scope Assessment

**✅ Scope is Appropriate:**
- Features directly address core problem (Kazakh-Russian transcription)
- 2-3 day timeline is realistic with chosen technology stack
- Each epic delivers incrementally deployable value
- Clear distinction between MVP and future enhancements

**Potential Scope Optimizations:**
- Story 2.6 (Advanced Upload Management) could be simplified for MVP
- Story 3.6 (Business Intelligence) might be Phase 2 candidate
- Multiple export formats could be reduced to 2-3 most critical

**Missing Essential Features:** None identified

## Technical Readiness

**✅ Strong Technical Foundation:**
- Clear technology stack decisions (Python Flask, Yandex API, SQLite)
- Realistic infrastructure choices (Heroku/DigitalOcean)
- Good separation of concerns in architecture
- Proper consideration of scaling path

**Areas for Architect Investigation:**
1. Yandex API rate limiting and quota management implementation
2. Concurrent processing architecture with Celery/Redis
3. File storage and cleanup automation mechanisms
4. Docker containerization and deployment pipeline

## Recommendations

**Before Architecture Phase:**
1. **Define API Failover Strategy:** Document specific steps when Yandex API is unavailable
2. **Clarify Data Policies:** Specify exact data retention, deletion, and privacy compliance procedures
3. **Cost Monitoring Plan:** Define real-time cost tracking and alert thresholds

**For Architecture Phase:**
1. Focus on robust error handling for external API dependencies
2. Design scalable file processing queue architecture
3. Plan monitoring and observability from day one
4. Consider Phase 2 migration path in architectural decisions

**MVP Refinement Suggestions:**
1. Consider reducing export formats to 3 most critical (Plain Text, SRT, JSON)
2. Simplify user management to session-based for MVP
3. Focus business intelligence on essential metrics only

## Final Decision

**✅ READY FOR ARCHITECT**

The PRD is comprehensive, well-structured, and provides sufficient detail for architectural design. The identified gaps are minor and can be addressed during architecture phase or refined based on architect feedback. MVP scope is realistic and focused on core value delivery.
