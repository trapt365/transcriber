2. Client-side file validation for supported formats (WAV, MP3, FLAC) и size limits (500MB)
3. Upload progress indicator с percentage completion и file transfer speed
4. Visual feedback for drag-and-drop states (drag-over, drop, upload-in-progress)
5. Form submission handling с file metadata extraction (duration, format, size)
6. Error handling for unsupported files, size exceeded, и network failures
7. Basic styling с Bootstrap 5 для professional appearance и mobile responsiveness
8. JavaScript upload functionality using modern File API without external libraries

## Story 1.4: Processing Status Tracking and Real-time Updates

As a **business user**,
I want **real-time updates on processing status**,
so that **I can understand progress и estimated completion time during the 10-15 minute transcription process**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Processing status page с real-time updates using Server-Sent Events или WebSocket
2. Status indicators for each processing phase: "Uploading → Processing → Generating Output → Complete"
3. Progress estimation based on file size и historical processing times
4. Cancel processing option с proper cleanup of resources и temporary files
5. Error state handling с clear error messages и suggested next steps
6. Automatic page refresh protection to maintain status connection after browser reload
7. Mobile-friendly status display с appropriate touch interactions
8. Processing queue position indicator if multiple files are being processed

## Story 1.5: Yandex SpeechKit API Integration

As a **system**,
I want **robust integration с Yandex SpeechKit API using universal language mode**,
so that **I can accurately transcribe mixed Kazakh-Russian audio с automatic language detection и speaker diarization**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Yandex SpeechKit Python SDK integration с API key management и authentication
2. Universal language mode configuration для automatic Kazakh-Russian detection
3. Audio file preprocessing для optimal API submission (format conversion, normalization)
4. Speaker diarization enabled through Yandex API settings с speaker separation
5. Retry logic for API failures с exponential backoff и error recovery
6. API response parsing to extract transcript, timestamps, и speaker labels
7. Cost tracking и usage monitoring для API calls to manage operational expenses
8. Integration tests с mock API responses и actual API validation (if credentials available)

## Story 1.6: Basic Transcript Generation and Display

As a **business user**,
I want **formatted transcript с speaker labels и timestamps**,
so that **I can review transcription accuracy и identify speakers in my meeting recording**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Transcript formatting с speaker labels ("Speaker 1:", "Speaker 2:") и timestamp markers
2. Basic transcript display page с scrollable content и speaker highlighting
3. Timestamp display in readable format (MM:SS или HH:MM:SS) aligned с audio segments
4. Speaker turn organization с clear visual separation between different speakers
5. Text formatting preservation for readability (paragraph breaks, punctuation)
6. Basic transcript validation против empty results или API errors
7. Character encoding handling для Kazakh Cyrillic и Russian text display
8. Simple transcript preview with first 500 characters для quick quality assessment

## Story 1.7: File Cleanup and Security Implementation

As a **system administrator**,
I want **automatic file cleanup и basic security measures**,
so that **user privacy is protected и storage costs are minimized через responsible data handling**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Automatic file deletion after 24 hours using scheduled cleanup task
2. Secure file storage с temporary directory isolation и proper permissions
3. Input validation и sanitization для all user uploads и form inputs
4. Rate limiting implementation to prevent abuse of upload и processing endpoints
