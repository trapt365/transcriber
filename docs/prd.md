# KazRu-STT Pro Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Сократить время транскрибации казахско-русских аудиозаписей с 12-15 часов до 10-15 минут
- Достичь ≥85% точности транскрибации для смешанной казахско-русской речи с code-switching
- Создать готовое коммерческое решение за 2-3 дня с минимальными техническими требованиями
- Снизить стоимость транскрибации на 70% (с $3-6 до $1-2 за 3-часовую запись)
- Обеспечить автоматическую диаризацию спикеров для многочасовых деловых встреч
- Создать foundation для будущего перехода на локальное решение при появлении GPU

### Background Context

KazRu-STT Pro решает критическую проблему отсутствия качественных решений для транскрибации длинных многоязычных записей в Казахстане. Существующие коммерческие провайдеры показывают только 60-75% точности для казахского языка и не поддерживают внутрифразовое переключение между языками, что приводит к "галлюцинациям" STT-систем.

Целевые пользователи - деловые профессионалы в двуязычной среде - тратят 8-12 часов в неделю на ручное создание протоколов встреч, что создает значительные временные и экономические потери. Решение использует Yandex SpeechKit с "универсальным режимом" как foundation для немедленного запуска, с возможностью поэтапной эволюции к локальному решению.

**Before Architecture Phase:**
1. **Define API Failover Strategy:** Document specific steps when Yandex API is unavailable
2. **Clarify Data Policies:** Specify exact data retention, deletion, and privacy compliance procedures
3. **Cost Monitoring Plan:** Define real-time cost tracking and alert thresholds

**For Architecture Phase:**
1. Focus on robust error handling for external API dependencies
2. Design scalable file processing queue architecture
3. Plan monitoring and observability from day one
4. Consider Phase 2 migration path in architectural decisions

**MVP Refinement Suggestions:**
1. Consider reducing export formats to 3 most critical (Plain Text, SRT, JSON)
2. Simplify user management to session-based for MVP
3. Focus business intelligence on essential metrics only

### Final Decision

**✅ READY FOR ARCHITECT**

The PRD is comprehensive, well-structured, and provides sufficient detail for architectural design. The identified gaps are minor and can be addressed during architecture phase or refined based on architect feedback. MVP scope is realistic and focused on core value delivery.

## Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

"Please review the attached KazRu-STT Pro PRD and create comprehensive UX architecture for the audio transcription platform. Focus on the critical 10-15 minute processing wait experience, multi-format export workflows, and professional business user interface. Pay special attention to user journey optimization for file upload → processing status → results review → export integration workflows. The target users are business professionals in Kazakhstan requiring intuitive, reliable transcription tools for mixed Kazakh-Russian audio content."

### Architect Prompt

"Please create technical architecture for KazRu-STT Pro based on the attached PRD. Key requirements: Python Flask/FastAPI backend, Yandex SpeechKit integration, concurrent processing for 5 users, SQLite→PostgreSQL evolution path, and Docker deployment. Critical focus areas: robust API error handling, file processing queue architecture, 24-hour cleanup automation, and Phase 2 foundation for local processing migration. Timeline: 2-3 day MVP delivery with production-ready scaling capability."
